# Unit Deliverable 2 - Final Project GUI
# Names - Philip Miethke, Brendan, Oscar
# Project Description
Our project is a simple Casino App that allows you to switch between different types of Card Games using a dropdown box and a start buttton for now we only have two players that can face off against each other and have not hooked everything up to GUI yet. But eventually you should be able to add bets before you hit, stand, and can add more players to play against. One aspect of our GUI that works right now is that it detects which card game you have selected andsays at the bottom left either started Blackjack or started Poker respectively.
